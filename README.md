 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, we are @RedBatToken are we are going to let you know a bit more about our project
 
What is Red Bat?

Red Bat is a revolutionary roleplaying game hosted on the Binance Smart Chain.

Players shall create their own characters to fight and defeat enemies, kill mobs, create clans (alliances), and much more. In addition to being able to create their own character with their distinctive characteristics and abilities, users will be able to craft their own weapons to be superior to the rest. Such weapons can be also customized. Characters and weapons can be traded in a community marketplace to obtain native tokens and create new characters or exchange them for stable coins.

Our mission

Our mission is to create a dynamic game that can connect players from all over the world through a revolutionary platform, which, in addition to being entertaining, will be a profitable experience for our players. Players can take control of their digital assets through the platform and grow them exponentially. We seek to make our players enjoy their time while earning profits.

Our story

The team is formed up by a bunch of players who met through a video game, and created a great friendship. We always looked forward to creating our own video game, and that such game becomes one of the best and most accepted in the world. So we decided to put all our knowledge as players together and put Red Bat in place.

We also liked the idea of the player getting rewarded by playing, instead of spending time on something with no impact on real life.

Thatâ€™s how it is! We are democratizing earning money online, without being a professional streamer, or participating in elaborated championships for the most qualified people.

Here, every player can be part and get profits without the need of being the best, as Red Bat looks to benefit its entire community and not just some part of it. We, as players know what gamers want, and we promise to give it to all of you there!

Requirements to PLAY

Red Bad is a web-based game application. The user will need to have access to the internet to play the game. Contracts are deployed on the Binance Smart Chain.
The player will need to have a nominal amount of BNB cryptocurrency to pay for transactional gas fees. They will need to have a wallet (i.e. Metamask) which can store the BNB cryptocurrency and which can also store the Red Bat token. The player will need to setup their Metamask wallet to the Binance Smart Chain network (tutorial on our website). They will need to hold a minimum of Red Bat tokens to start the game and these can be purchased initially at PancakeSwap.

Gameplay and purpose of the game

Red bat will allow players to create their own characters in their own image and likeness. Once his character is created, the users starts being part of the massive multiplayer online role-playing game.

The objective of each character is to level up and become stronger through different skills, that he will be able to acquire depending on its level, and also through weapons and armor.

Just as each character will be different, so will be the weapons crafted by themselves for each character, or bought in the community marketplace.
Players will be able to farm and level up in different designed areas or cities. Depending on the skills and weapons each player has, will be easier or more difficult to level up in any given areas.

In these areas, players will find different types of mobs, which will give experience and allow players to level up. The main mob will be the Red Bat Boss, which will provide a greater amount of experience (XP) and tokens. These mobs are difficult to find and kill, but the reward will be higher than the one given by other mobs.

It is advisable to search for and kill the Red Bat bosses through a party with several players, for example, all clan members.

Many people will be looking for these mobs, and clashes between parties can be generated to kill them. The strongest party will prevail and the weakest will die, loosing XP.

Once a character dies, it will have a 10-minute cool down, which can be avoided by contributing tokens. once the 10 minutes have passed, it reappears in the nearest city.

All characters have a certain amount of HP and MP depending on its level, their skills and weapons. The HP is the life that, when reaching 0, means that the player is dead. On the other hand, the MP is the mana to perform actions and skills, this will be depleted with each action that the player performs. To recharge the MP, the player has to be inside of the city.

A player will not be able to kill another character within the city. PvP areas will be the farming areas. However, users will be able to find some exclusive farming areas where it will not be allowed to kill other players.

Each player will be able to create their own clan, and invite other players to join it. Clans will allow players to help each other and achieve objectives more quickly.

Rewards

For every mob that each player kills, it will get Red Bat tokens. Of course, the amount of Red Bat token rewarded depends on each mobâ€™s level, being the Red Bat Boss the one giving the highest reward. Every time a player is killed by a mob, it will lose a certain amount of Red Bat tokens. Again, the amount will depend on the mobâ€™s and the player level.

On the other hand, when a PvP (player versus player) takes place, the character that kills the other gets a fixed network fee of Red Bat tokens that comes out of the other playerâ€™s wallet, in case the other player does not have such amount of Red Bat Token, he is going to remain with a negative balance until paid.
Token usage

Red bat token is the native currency of our platform and game. It will be able to be acquired through a pre-sale or in the main decentralized exchanges of the Binance Smart Chain network.

To create an initial character a certain minimum amount of tokens will be required. Then, each user can play and earn their own tokens within the game.
Once in the game the characters can obtain more tokens by killing mobs. These tokens will be able to be used to create exclusive weapons and armor, level up, create clans, buy potions of HP and MP for faster recovery, buy different items available in the community marketplace (offered by other users), learn new skills for your character, and much more.

The tokens used in the game are the same tokens that are obtained as rewards, and the same tokens that can be bought or sold on the main exchanges of the Binance Smart Chain network.
