 👋 Hi, we are @RedBatToken are we are going to let you know a bit more about our project
 
What is Red Bat?

Red Bat is a revolutionary photo-sharing social network that aims to open up a highly profitable and viable stream of revenue for social media content & fans. Users will be able to leverage the power of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to sell limited prints of their favorite moments to a broad audience of members. 

Creators will also be able to create unique user profiles with their own personalized, dedicated staking pool. Staking pools will provide patrons & fans with access to exclusive user content as well as offer weighted staking rewards that can then be claimed and redeemed on the platform for further use.

Additionally, these NFTs are digitally coded, data encrypted, and securely minted by using blockchain technology. In this way NFT’s ensure the individual’s ownership of their

Content and add a further layer of protection to intellectual property.

The Red Bat platform is designed with the amateur user in mind. Red Bat Token proprietary technology allows someone with little to no experience to create NFTs with ease — directly on the web app with only a few simple clicks — and to immediately begin to monetize their work and connect with their followers in a fun and efficient way.

Red Bat is backed and created by
 a top-notch team that includes blockchain industry leaders, business professionals, engineers, web designers, marketing and social media experts, strategists and more. All of them, led by our Chief Technologist: Matt Jargon. All of us are working together to make Red Bat the first choice for liking, posting, and sharing minted content across the web.

The Red Bat has also developed The Red Bat Token (BAT), which is a community token soon to be launched on Binance Smart Chain. However, unlike other community tokens, Red Bat also is backed up by a solid project and team: the NFT platform. The Red Bat Token offers the best of both worlds: (a) a community-governed token with great rewards for its holders and (b) a solid and innovative project that will attract investors.

The Red Bat Token combines an innovative Auto-Liquidity feature that increases liquidity of the token rapidly with an Auto-Staking SmartContract for Red Bat Token holders, constantly assigning a quota of every transaction to the existing holders.

The Black Hole
We have created a Black Hole for Red Bat Token which already owns 30% of total supply at launch. This means, Red Bat Token already burnt over 30% of its initial supply.

Key Points
Red Bat is the first of its kind. It is the only socially engineered, digital media sharing platform that rewards users for creating, buying, and selling digital content. Red Bat most active and creative members also have exclusive access to private content.

Red Bat empowers creators and fans like never before. With just a few clicks, users can easily take any digital content — including photos, videos, and art — directly from their smartphone or other media devices and turn it into NFTs.

These NFTs are then “minted” using blockchain technology, which transforms user content into unique stores of value that can be easily bought, sold and traded worldwide. Find your global audience through Red Bat Token network and community.

Solution
Red Bat offers a creative solution to rethink how we use social media platforms, by leveraging NFTs and introducing the BAT token.

NFT’s are “non-fungible”, meaning that each one or each set of NFTs minted are absolutely unique unto themselves, similar to a unique piece of art or intellectual property.

One way that BAT token holders can earn rewards is through staking. BAT tokens can be staked within individual user staking pools, and used both to unlock exclusive content and to purchase NFT’s within the BAT platform.

Staking pools offer a chance for content creators to grow their following and brand.

At the same time, they may offer exclusive content to stakers and redeemable rewards paid out in BAT tokens “per block”, which is on average about every 10 minutes.

In addition, content creators are incentivized to grow their pools and are allotted 20% of the total pool weight in staking rewards. The more influential an individual is on the platform, the higher their potential to earn passive revenue.

Thanks to Red Bat proprietary platform technology, Red Bat has been able to fully streamline the process of creating NFTs and managing BAT tokens, which allows for even amateur users to easily navigate the web app.

Red Bat is an all-encompassing social ecosystem that thrives off of user engagement, and is built to create online communities incentivized to lift each other up.

About The Red Bat Token and its Token Metrics:
Unruggable

Liquidity is locked in PancakeSwap and ownership of the contract will been transferred to a burn address right after launch. Also BAT’s SmartContract is 100% safu, as can be checked and verified in third party platforms.

Fair Launch

96% of the BAT total supply is seeded as liquidity or burnt. That means there iso risk of price-dumping.

Safe Auto-Staking

3% of all transactions are distributed to holders. Watch your wallet climb the minute you begin holding. No need to send your tokens to risky pools in order to get a passive income.

100% Decentralized

BAT token is community led, since ownership will be burnt after listing and launch is going to be almost completely seeded as liquidity or burnt. BAT token governance will be done by and for holders.

Continuously Rising Price Floor

3% of every transaction is locked as liquidity in the PancakeSwap BAT/BNB pool, creating an ever rising price floor. This in addition to the Black Hole, makes the circulating supply of BAT lesser on every transaction, meaning that the liquidity is distributed among less circulating tokens, meaning that the price is rising continuously.

Whale Shock Safety

No wallet holds more than 1% of token supply and no transaction can involve more than 1,000,000 BAT tokens. Team wallet, which is locked for 6 months, only holds 1% of the supply. Airdrop wallet will be distributed among participants.

Total supply: 100,000,000 BAT

How are the tokens distributed?
· 66% is destined to presale and seeded as liquidity;

· 30% is at the Black Hole;

· 3% is destined to Airdroppers who meet every requirement;

· Only 1% is destined to the team for their efforts and investments. Such tokens are locked for 6 months and will be vested for 3 additional months.
